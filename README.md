# Vacuum Adapter Parkside POF1200

This provides the CAD and the STL for a rebuild of the vacuum adapter for the  Parkside POF 1200 routing machine.

Actually, I do not own this machine but rather construced and printed it for a friend. The angle for the hose is a little off, though, as in this construction it is about 10deg too steep. However, it should fit.

I used 90% PLA with support to print the adaper as strong as possible.
